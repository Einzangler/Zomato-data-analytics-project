# Zomato-data-analytics-project
Hey there ,  I have worked on a project where I performed data analytics and visualisation on a zomato dataset 

As a part of this project,  I worked  on the Zomato Dataset available here 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeshrampure/zomato-dataset

I Performed the following tasks before starting on the feature list
Explored the Dataset
Data Cleaning
Data Visualization (Figuring out the best way to represent the analysis )

KEY FEATURES I ANALYZED USING THE DATASET IN THIS PROJECT :

Restaurants that are providing online booking vs the ones which are not
Ratings of Restaurants with online ordering and without online ordering
How location affects the ratings of the online orders
Types of restaurants with online orders based on location
Cost of restaurants with table booking based on location
Ranking of most popular restaurant types based on votes
